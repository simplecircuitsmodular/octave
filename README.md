# Sub Oscillator

This module features -1,-2, and -3 octave square wave outputs, selectable via a rotary switch. An input through jack allows the original signal to be passed on to other modules, while an attenuator and enable switch allow the sub oscillator to be easily added and removed from your mix.

## Files
### octave_xx .brd and .sch
These are the board and schematic files needed to manufacture PCBs. Gerbers need to be generated in Eagle for manufacturing.

### octaveParts_xx.md
These are the parts lists for each module. A mouser BOM is available in this file as well.

### octave.ai
This is the panel in Adobe Illustrator format. I make my panels on a laser cutter with 1/8 inch acrylic.
