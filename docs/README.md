### Overview

This module features -1,-2, and -3 octave square wave outputs, selectable via a rotary switch. An input through jack allows the original signal to be passed on to other modules, while an attenuator and enable switch allow the sub oscillator to be easily added and removed from your mix.

### Design

This is the second true analog module I have designed. It uses the common 4024 IC to generate square waves. The input and output are buffered, but the module does not have reverse polarity protection.

### Buy

I'll be updating this part soon with a link to buy PCBs on Reverb. For the time being you can email me to purchase development PCBs at a discount. These will be fully functional but have minor issues.
